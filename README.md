# spotify_playlist
scrapes billboard top 100 for specific date (week of entered date in yyyy-mm-dd format) to find songs to add to spotify playlist using spotipy

lets you keep creating playlists
makes sure that you can get songs from billboard top 100 (won't move on to spotify part until you have a list of songs/artists)

todo:
check if play list already exists
playlist shouldnt change because billboard top 100 shouldnt change, but if at a later date trying to add different songs, check if song already in playlist
